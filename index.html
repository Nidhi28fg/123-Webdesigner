                The Process of Carpet weaving involves multiple steps and the most essential is designing and creating your own identity. A company is known by its designing team and the creativity with which the carpet is planned to be weaved. The next most crucial step is Procurement of yarn. There are more than 40 types of yarns which are used in handmade carpet weaving with each having multiple grades. The right quality yarn makes all the difference. The yarn is then moved to Dyeing which gives life to the fiber and we at Mahesh Exports use Azzo free dyes to assure the best quality for our clients. Weaving and finishing of the carpets is done by skilled artisans which becomes the backbone of any good quality handmade carpet. Inspection and Packaging are the final steps before the carpet is displaced. We at Mahesh Exports have professional internal inspection standards which helps our clients to rely on us.
